# Introduction to Ethereum

## What is Ethereum in a nutshell
- The Ethereum Blockchain is an immutable public databse that stores records of all the transactions that have ever taken place. This ensures that if someone were to try to change something (Let's say illegally forge money to their name), we will be able to know if there has been tampering with the blockchain, and it will be able to resist any of those changes through standard network checks.

- Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with its own improvements  

- Ethereum allows you to send ___Ether___ to run smart contracts which are decentralized applications

    - *Note*: The name of the blockchain is Ethereum. The name of the cryptocurrency is Ether or Eth.<br><br>

- In summary, Ethereum is used to send digital money called Eth ***OR*** run decentralized  applications called smart contracts.

- Ethereum is:
    - Decentralized
        - No central company or entity could shut down the Ethereum applications
    - Immutable
    - Unstoppable
        - Once a smart contract (An agreement translated into code) is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, it runs forever and cannot be stopped
    - Censorship-free
        - No third-party can interfere and stop anyone else from using the Ethereum network. 
    - More private than web2
    - No downtime
