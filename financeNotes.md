# HFT - High Frequency Trading

## What the hell is high frequency trading anyways?

    High Frequency Trading - A method of trading that uses powerful computer programs to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second.

Instead of people making trades within the market, financial firms are taking advantage of a computer's processing capabilities. These clusters of computers are making multiple trades per second. Due to sheer speed of these trades, these firms are able to capitalize on profit-making-opportunities in the market that only last fractions of a second.
