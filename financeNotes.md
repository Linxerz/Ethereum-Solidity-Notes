# HFT - High Frequency Trading

## What the hell is high frequency trading anyways?

    High Frequency Trading - A method of trading that uses powerful computer programs to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second.

Instead of people making trades within the market, financial firms are taking advantage of a computer's processing capabilities. These clusters of computers are making multiple trades per second. Due to sheer speed of these trades, these firms are able to capitalize on profit-making-opportunities in the market that only last fractions of a second.

### **Types of HFT bots:**

***News Bots:*** 
- These computer trading bots make trades based on the information they gather from the news / online articles / social media posts. 

- These bots will scan the words off these reports, and generate an idea of whether the news is positive or negative. Based off that data the bot will automatically decide on how to trade different types of stock almost instantly before other people have time to react.
